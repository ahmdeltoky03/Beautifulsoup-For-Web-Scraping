# `web_scrapping`

### Web Scrapping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using specialized software or scripts. It allows users to efficiently collect and analyze large amounts of information from the web.



### I use a popular tool in Python called BeautifulSoup, which is a powerful tool suitable for many needs of analyzing and extracting data from web pages, especially when the pages are complex or not well structured.

### If you want to scrap Data From Web_Page click `Web_Page` and If you want to scrap Data from Json click `Json_File`
